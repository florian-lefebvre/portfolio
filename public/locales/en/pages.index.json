At the beginning of high school, I then turned to web development. I am now about to follow a course at [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course) and get the diploma of web designer and developer.",

I have skills in UI/UX design (I worked on design systems), project management (with amazing tools like [Linear](https://linear.app)) and I have continued to learn new technologies and improve my skills.",
