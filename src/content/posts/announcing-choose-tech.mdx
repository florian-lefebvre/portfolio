Web development has truly become incredible. The evolution between the creation
of the World Wide Web and today is just monstruous (in a positive way)! I
haven't coded for so long compared to many other devs out there (almost 4 years)
but even at this scale, there were important revolutions.

Even though that's really good, it comes at a cost: choosing the right tech. Yes
it's awesome to have 2M packages available on NPM but at some point you need to
know what's best for you and your company. And _this_ is hard.

I really like initiatives such as [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/), powered by
the OSS community, that aims to provide guidance in this wide ecosystem.

## Inspiration

Before actually talking about what is Choose Tech, I'd like to give credits to
[David Dahan](https://david-dahan.com/) for his project
[UI Lib picker](https://ui-libs.vercel.app/). I basically wanted to make it
fully generic.

## What's Choose Tech?

Choose Tech is a resource portal. It allows devs to pick a tech for their next
project more easily.

Repos under the [Choose Tech organization](https://github.com/choose-tech) are
owned by their respective communities, eg.
[javascript-libraries](https://github.com/choose-tech/javascript-libraries) is
managed and maintained by JS/TS community members.

That allows core members of CT to focus on improving the website and tooling for
contributors while the community focuses on content.

Speaking of tooling, Choose Tech is powered by [Astro](https://astro.build) and
its powerful
[integration API](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/integrations-reference/).
It allows contributors to deal with a minimal boilerplate.

## How can I help?

Choose Tech provides the tools but without the community (you!), it's nothing.
That's why I need your help:

1. For existing comparisons, we need more resources and help better categorizing
   them. That's managed by comparisons' maintainers
2. For missing comparisons,
   [create an issue](https://github.com/choose-tech/choose-tech/issues/new/choose)
   and I'll add it!
3. Give visibility by sharing project on social media

That's all for me, enjoy and
[start browsing](https://choose-tech.com/#comparisons)!
