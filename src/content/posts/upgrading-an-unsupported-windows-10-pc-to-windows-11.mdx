It took me a while (several hours, to be exact) to successfully upgrade my
unsupported Windows 10 PC to the latest version, Windows 11. In this article, I
hope to share my experiences and any lessons learned to help others avoid
similar pitfalls.

## Bypassing Windows 11 Requirements with the Registry

There is an
[official way](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ways-to-install-windows-11-e0edbbfb-cfc5-4011-868b-2ce77ac7c70e)
to bypass the Windows 11 requirements by adding a value to the registry. Here's
how to do it:

1. Open the registry by searching for it in the Windows menu or by pressing
   `Win` + `R` and typing `regedit`.
2. Navigate to `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup`. If the
   `MoSetup` directory doesn't exist, right click on `Setup > New > Key` and
   name it `MoSetup`.
3. If it doesn't exist already, create a new DWORD record (right click,
   `New > DWORD (32 bit) value`) and name it
   `AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU`. Set its value to `1` (hexadecimal, by
   default).
4. Restart your PC to apply the changes.

## Determining Your Default System UI Language

Before downloading the ISO, it's important to determine your **Default system UI
language**. This is different from your current system UI language and cannot be
changed. I learned this the hard way, wasting two hours of my life...

To find your Default system UI language:

1. Launch the command prompt (`cmd`) as an administrator by searching for it in
   the Windows task bar, right clicking on the program, and selecting
   `Open as administrator`.
2. Run the following command: `dism /online /get-intl` and note the
   `Default system UI language`.

## Downloading and Installing the Correct ISO

After completing the above steps, it's finally time to upgrade! Head over to the
[official download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/software-download/windows11).

Under `Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO)`, select the option you want, then
**be sure to select the language that corresponds to what you obtained in the
previous step**.

Download the ISO, save it to your disk, and double click it to run the
`setup.exe` file. Follow the prompts to begin the installation process and enjoy
Windows 11!
