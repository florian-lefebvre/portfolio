Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences
with you. This is my first post for the 5th version of my portfolio, and I'm
glad to finally have some ideas to share.

I had included a blog in the first two versions of my website, but I didn't have
much to say at the time. This empty space was a bit annoying, so I decided to
remove it until v5. Since September 15, 2022, I've actually had some things to
say and have been writing about them in the README. You can check it out
[there](/blog/upgrading-an-unsupported-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/).

I hope you'll find my articles interesting and enjoy reading them. Thanks for
stopping by!
