title: Upgrading an unsupported Windows 10 PC to Windows 11
description:
    For no reason at all, I decided to spend an entire afternoon upgrading my unsupported
    Windows 10 PC to Windows 11. I came across a lot of stupid mistakes so I decided to write about it.

It took me a while (several hours actually) to manage to do the upgrade. I hope this article can help you!

<Alert>

My PC wasn't eligible for the Windows 11 upgrade because of unsupported CPU.
This article is probably not relevant for any other incomptability reason.

## Getting into the registry

There is an [official way](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ways-to-install-windows-11-e0edbbfb-cfc5-4011-868b-2ce77ac7c70e)
to bypass the Windows 11 requirements by adding a value to the registry. Here is how :

Open the registry. You can either search in the Windows menu or be a bit more
efficient by pressing `Win` + `R` and typing `regedit`.

Navigate to `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup`. If the `MoSetup` directory doesn't exist,
right click on `Setup > New > Key` and call it `MoSetup`.

If it doesn't exist already, create a new DWORD record (right click, `New > DWORD (32 bit) value`)
and name it `AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU`. Set its value to `1` (hexadecimal, by default).

Finally, restart your PC to apply the changes.

## Choosing the right language

Before downloading the ISO, you must know what is your Default system UI language, which
is different from your current system UI language and cannot be change. I tried to do so
and lost 2 hours of me life...

Launch the command prompt (`cmd`) as administrator by searching in Windows task bar,
right clicking on the program and selecting `Open as administrator`.

Run the following command : `dism /online /get-intl` and get the `Default system UI language`.

## Downloading the right ISO & installing

After all those steps, it's finally time to upgrade! Head over to the
[official download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/software-download/windows11).

Under `Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO)`, select the option you want then **be sure to
select the language that corresponds to what you obtained in the previous step**.

Download it and once saved to your disk, double click it and run the `setup.exe` file. Enjoy Windows 11!
