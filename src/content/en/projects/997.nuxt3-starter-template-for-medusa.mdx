## Introduction

<Alert>

Unfortunately, this project is no longer maintained due to lack of time and a
shift to the React ecosystem on my side.

</Alert>

This project is storefront template for [Medusa](https://medusajs.com/), built
with [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com).

It features products view with filters, product details and a shopping cart.
[More features](https://github.com/florian-lefebvre/nuxt3-starter-medusa#routes)
were planned but because the project is unmaintained, the project remains
unfortunately quite incomplete.

This project was fully frontend focused, powered by those technologies:

-   [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com)
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
-   [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)

## Purpose and Goal

When I first discovered Medusa, I was coding with Vue and Nuxt. However,
official templates only included [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

My ambition was to create a fully featured and nice looking template for Nuxt 3,
equivalent of the official Next.js one. It was also an opportunity to learn how
to create e-commerce sites.

## Spotlight: state management and stores

This web app was one of the first to require complex state management. I had
only been using [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) and the official default was now
Pinia.

The goal was pretty simple: translate the
[React Contexts](https://react.dev/reference/react#context-hooks) into
[Pinia stores](https://react.dev/reference/react#context-hooks).

Being used to the Vuex mental model, I started using
[Options Stores](https://pinia.vuejs.org/core-concepts/#option-stores) but
eventually switched to
[Setup Stores](https://pinia.vuejs.org/core-concepts/#setup-stores), which make
more sense in Vue 3.

I encountered small issues with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
but that was because I lacked experience.

In the end, DX was really good!

## Current status

Unfortunately, this project is no longer maintained due to lack of time and a
shift to the React ecosystem on my side.

## Lessons Learned

I learned a few things while doing this template:

-   Deal with complex state management
-   Understand React Context
-   Get started with Medusa
