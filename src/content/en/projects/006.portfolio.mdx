## Purpose and Goal

-   why: showcase my skills, force me to learn new techs and polish a lot,
    increase my chances to get hired
-   For the v5, I made mockups on [Figma](https://figma.com). Here is a
    screenshot but you can find more on my
    [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LfbvrFlo) (links below).

I also planned what content I would put in [Notion](https://notion.so) before
coding too much.

## A quick history

I've updated my website many times yet, but this time I'm confident: this
version will stay there for a while!

### Jekyll and Bootstrap 5

![Screenshot of the portfolio v1](/images/content/en/projects/portfolio-2.png)

Back in August 2020, I had to choose technologies to build my portfolio. At the
time, I knew HTML5, CSS & SCSS, PHP and Bootstrap.

Because I spent a lot of time on [Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs)
in the previous months, I knew that static site generators existed (since
Bootstrap docs use Hugo). So I searched for the best fit for me and eventually
found [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

It uses the [Liquid syntax](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) and relies
on [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/). I knew nothing about both of them so and
it made it harder to build my portfolio.

I used a template I found on the Internet, tweaked it a bit but I won't lie: it
was bad.

And setting the deployment was hard since GitHub Actions were not released yet
so I had to use Travis CI and GitHub Pages to release my portfolio.

So as I was learning more about frontend development and in particular
JavaScript frameworks, I decided a few months later to rebuild my portfolio from
scratch.

### Nuxt 2 and Tailwind CSS 1.0

![Screenshot of the portfolio v2](/images/content/en/projects/portfolio-3.png)

I learned a lot of things since August 2020, so I decided to go with
[Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

I chose to use a sidebar for navigation and now I think that wasn't a good
choice. The space I was loosing for only a few infos was too much. But anyway, I
chose the color teal as a primary color. I also used the official Nuxt modules
such as [`@nuxt/content`](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) but I struggled with the
layout on some specific screen widths with weird horizontal overflow, caused by
code blocks.

This time, I used Travis CI and a Plesk server to deploy my portfolio.

For further explanations about v1 and v2, check out
[this archive](https://github.com/florian-lefebvre/portfolio/blob/v2_nuxtjs/content/work/2020-11-13-my-porfolio.md).

But as always, I wasn't satisfied of my work and thought it wasn't good enough
as a showcase of my skills. So I remade it of course!

### Nuxt 2 and Tailwind CSS 2.0

![Screenshot of the portfolio v3](/images/content/en/projects/portfolio-4.png)

I'm not crazy, I don't use a new technology every day so I kept using Nuxt and
Tailwind CSS. I decided to so something more simple: only one page with all
informations. I chose some kind of minimalist design with only gray shades and
no primary color. I also implemented a dark mode. I discovered animations using
[AnimXYZ](https://animxyz.com/) but I've got to say that it wasn't that easy to
do animations with it.

But this simplicity didn't reflect enough my capabilities IMO so you know what
it means...

### Nuxt 3 and Tailwind CSS 3.0

![Screenshot of the portfolio v4](/images/content/en/projects/portfolio-5.png)

I upgraded Nuxt to its 3rd version (in beta) as well as Tailwind CSS (no major
changes). And I've got to say that Nuxt 3 and Vue 3 are absolutely amazing
compared to their previous major versions. Typescript is _the_ best. But using
Nuxt 3 in beta has downsides, for stability (laggy HMR), weird broken imports or
missing features. I'm mostly enjoying using it.

Concerning animations, I switched to
[`@vueuse/motion`](https://motion.vueuse.org/) and it's really better.

In fact, because nuxt's ecosystem isn't compatible yet, I had to dive a bit
deeper in Nuxt and learned how to build modules (for generating a sitemap for
instance) and that was really enriching.

If you're curious about it, I created a custom sitemap module,
[check it out](https://github.com/florian-lefebvre/portfolio/blob/c513428dea912a19ffb684b8b571b08b8882158c/modules/sitemap.ts).

I deploy my portfolio on Vercel, the process is way simpler than on GitHub
Actions or any other CI since Nuxt has first class integrations for deployments.

<Alert>

Do you miss this version? It's still available at
[v4.florian-lefebvre.dev](https://v4.florian-lefebvre.dev)!

</Alert>

But then I found out [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)'s
[e-book](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/effective-portfolio/): _"Building an
Effective Dev Portfolio"_. So I decided to rebuild my portfolio, but with more
thinking evolved so that it can't stay great for a long time.

## Current status

TBD

-   This section is optional. If the project is actively being used by real
    people, talk a little bit about the current status, who uses it, why they
    use it, what they say to you about it, stuff like that.
-   If the project was contrived specifically for the portfolio, omit this
    section.

## Lessons Learned

TBD

-   What did you learn doing this project? Feel free to list multiple things.
    Also feel free to cover non-technical lessons. It's great to talk about how
    you learned to use an advanced feature of a framework or library, but it's
    just as valuable to talk about project-management experience, or things you
    learned about shipping projects.
-   If you used a framework or other libraries/tools, was it a good choice? How
    did it help? In which ways was it insufficient?
-   Is your project accessible? What did you learn about accessibility, while
    building this project? Describing how you tested your project using keyboard
    navigation or a screenreader can make for a really compelling story!
-   How has this affected the work you've done since then? Real examples of how
    this project built your knowledge for future projects is fantastic.
