    This is the website that got me started with web development. I actually
    reworked it 3 times to learn, improving it each time!

## Introduction

This website is a showcase site for my orchestra, _l'Orchestre d'Harmonie du
Frontonnais_. Nothing complicated, it made of a few pages : home, about the
orchestra, its story, upcoming schedule, medias and contact.

I was doing frontend development for this project, using
[Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and
[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) for the 3rd version.

Check out the [website](https://ohf31.fr)!

## Purpose and Goal

At the end of 2019, I was getting involved more and more in my orchestra's
online presence. Indeed, I was filming concerts with several cameras and editing
videos to publish on social medias (nothing crazy, only fades in and out). But
one thing was still not looking great: the website.

Made with an old [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) template, I was looking for a
solution to make the website look better and more professional. So I thought
_“Why not learn HTML along the way?”_ and I got started.

This website is important for me because it's really what got me started in web
development.

## Multiple versions

### 1. HTML and CSS

I never really coded before, I mean I coded in Unreal Engine 4 with blueprints
but it was a visual editor, not lines of code. So to start I followed
[this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE) from Traversy Media
and it taught a lot of thing. I wasn't understanding the half of the CSS I was
writing (and I was using `float`...) but still, I managed to get this first
website done.

I remember deploying this website over FTP using
[FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) on OVH around Christmas.

So definitely a great way to start!

### The musicians space

Like a lot of devs out there, I decided I wanted to build my own CMS instead of
using [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/). Why would I use a really popular CMS
since I know everything to build a full custom one on my own? (Spoiler: _I
wasn't ready_)

So I started to learn PHP, I mean not a framework but really procedural PHP. The
code was an absolute mess, absolutely not secure, duplications everywhere and so
on. To be able to refresh some parts of the Ui without the whole page, I used
AJAX with [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) so I a way, I was building some kind of
small APIs. _BUT_ I was returning HTML, not JSON, stored in a string. It was an
absolute nightmare to debug.

But still, I learned a lot along the way, especially about
[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and CSS.

### 2. Bootstrap 5 and PHP

<Alert>

I didn't manage to find a screenshot for this one.

As I was coding the musicians space at the same time, I discovered
[Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) and was really enjoying it. So, to
train and because the first version of the website wasn't looking that great
after all, I decided to rebuild it from scratch. I was still using PHP for
imports (html meta tags or stuff like this) but in retrospect, it wasn't useful.

### 3. Nuxt 3 and Tailwind CSS

![Screenshot of 3rd version](/images/content/en/projects/ohf31-0.png)

The 2nd version had been released for more than a year and then... _"We need to
add an announce now that we can do concerts, and the next one is in 1 week and
half. Could you add it?"_ Sure I can but... My tech stack has changed a lot
since last year, I was only beginning learning web development and I don't have
the right setup nor the will to get back to such tech. So guess what... 3rd
version!

The deadline was the 10th of November and at the time I was looking for a way to
try out Nuxt 3 now that beta was released since October. Well, it was instable
and I had quite a lot of issues (of which HMR which is really painful) but
eventually I managed to get it working. That was also the opportunity to try
[VueUse motion](https://motion.vueuse.org/) for animations.

I used Tailwind CSS for styling, GitHub for versioning (after all that time!),
[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) as a CDN for my images and
[Vercel](https://vercel.com) for deployments.

Apart from the technical side, I didn't really change the whole layouts or
content.

Since then, I updated the app to use the `3.0.0` release, improving stability
and performance.

## Current status

The website is working pretty well and I haven't planned any further development
for now.

However, it's not that visited right now but this is because of a marketing
issue: no many people are even aware of the orchestra's existence. I might work
on that in the future, establishing a digital marketing strategy etc...

I'm also considering plugging in a CMS for people to enter data (like future
concerts), I need to investigate.

## Lessons Learned

This project has taught me a lot of things, web development at first and new
techs then, each version allowing me to learn more technologies.
