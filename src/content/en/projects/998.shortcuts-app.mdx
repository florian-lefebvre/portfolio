title: 'Shortcuts app: inspired by Opera pinned chats'
description:
    As I was enjoying the integrated chat feature of Opera, I thought I could
    create a dedicated desktop app.

## Introduction

Shortcuts App is born from a completely stolen idea from the Opera browser:
[messengers](https://www.opera.com/features/messenger). This feature allows to
have messengers web apps running in the sidebar. They are different from normal
tabs because they're like _"native"_ apps living in your sidebar. Pretty handy!

And I thought: _"What if I coded this in a dedicated app?"_ and I did so.
Looking back at it, it looks like a simplified browser running on a full
Chromium instance...

Anyway, it did sound good to me and I implemented the following features:

-   Adding a shortcut
-   Removing a shortcut
-   Reordering shortcuts
-   Auto updating

I did everything by myself using the following techs:

-   [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
-   [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (version 2)
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

Here is the [repo](https://github.com/florian-lefebvre/shortcuts-app).

## Purpose and Goal

Well, I found the idea pretty wise
([eggsy](https://github.com/florian-lefebvre/shortcuts-app/issues/1) as well)
and I also wanted to try out Electron.

My only goal was to produce the 4 features I mentioned above...and an app that
just work.

I didn't much planning as I had only been coding for 1 year as a self-taught.

## Spotlight: app update

Delivering updates is a critical part of software development. It's even more
true on desktop where most apps don't come from stores, which manage updates for
you.

I'm not magician, I used a really cool library called
[electron-updater](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) that
uses Github releases to publish updates. The app then looks for new releases in
the github repo and fetches the new binary.

## Current status

That was a quick project (1 week only) and I stopped there but I'm sure there is
much to do with the idea!

Actually, I feel like [Sidekick](https://www.meetsidekick.com/) achieves the
same, but much cleaner. _But not open-source!_

## Lessons Learned

This project allowed me to learn Electron, but also to use Vue.js in a different
environment (different from browser).

I also had a quick look at code signing and looks like
[it can't be achieved for free for OSS](https://github.com/florian-lefebvre/shortcuts-app/issues/1#issuecomment-753310269).

Concerning the techs, I'm happy with my choices. I initially wanted to use
Alpine.js but couldn't get it to work. I lacked experience and just turned out
to Vue as I used before, but I've used this tool since then without much issues.
