## Introduction

I think a developer's portfolio is a showcase of their skills. And this is true
by the projects it contains, but also because a portfolio is one of them!

For this 5th version, I've greatly improved a lot of aspects:

-   **Light and dark mode**: choose the one that suits you best
-   **A blog (finally!)** powered by MDX
-   **Excellent performance** thanks to Astro
-   **Great accessibility**
-   **Internationalization** with `i18n-next`
-   **Respect of animation preferences** using `prefers-reduce-motion`

I use the following technologies:

-   [Astro](https://astro.build) (SSG)
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
-   [React](https://react.dev)
-   [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
-   [Swup.js](https://swup.js.org/)
-   [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)

## Purpose and Goal

As explained in the introduction, I think it's really important to have a great
portfolio as a web developer. Moreover, it allows me to learn new things along
the way (mostly Astro in this case), which is alway nice.

I also made quite some effots on planning this time: I made mockups on
[Figma](https://figma.com). Here is a screenshot but you can find more on my
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/LfbvrFlo) (links below).

I also planned what content I would put in [Notion](https://notion.so) before
coding too much.

## A quick history

I've updated my website many times yet, but this time I'm confident: this
version will stay there for a while!

### Jekyll and Bootstrap 5

![Screenshot of the portfolio v1](/images/content/en/projects/portfolio-2.png)

Back in August 2020, I had to choose technologies to build my portfolio. At the
time, I knew HTML5, CSS & SCSS, PHP and Bootstrap.

Because I spent a lot of time on [Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs)
in the previous months, I knew that static site generators existed (since
Bootstrap docs use Hugo). So I searched for the best fit for me and eventually
found [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

It uses the [Liquid syntax](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) and relies
on [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/). I knew nothing about both of them so and
it made it harder to build my portfolio.

I used a template I found on the Internet, tweaked it a bit but I won't lie: it
was bad.

And setting the deployment was hard since GitHub Actions were not released yet
so I had to use Travis CI and GitHub Pages to release my portfolio.

So as I was learning more about frontend development and in particular
JavaScript frameworks, I decided a few months later to rebuild my portfolio from
scratch.

### Nuxt 2 and Tailwind CSS 1.0

![Screenshot of the portfolio v2](/images/content/en/projects/portfolio-3.png)

I learned a lot of things since August 2020, so I decided to go with
[Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

I chose to use a sidebar for navigation and now I think that wasn't a good
choice. The space I was loosing for only a few infos was too much. But anyway, I
chose the color teal as a primary color. I also used the official Nuxt modules
such as [`@nuxt/content`](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) but I struggled with the
layout on some specific screen widths with weird horizontal overflow, caused by
code blocks.

This time, I used Travis CI and a Plesk server to deploy my portfolio.

For further explanations about v1 and v2, check out
[this archive](https://github.com/florian-lefebvre/portfolio/blob/v2_nuxtjs/content/work/2020-11-13-my-porfolio.md).

But as always, I wasn't satisfied of my work and thought it wasn't good enough
as a showcase of my skills. So I remade it of course!

### Nuxt 2 and Tailwind CSS 2.0

![Screenshot of the portfolio v3](/images/content/en/projects/portfolio-4.png)

I'm not crazy, I don't use a new technology every day so I kept using Nuxt and
Tailwind CSS. I decided to so something more simple: only one page with all
informations. I chose some kind of minimalist design with only gray shades and
no primary color. I also implemented a dark mode. I discovered animations using
[AnimXYZ](https://animxyz.com/) but I've got to say that it wasn't that easy to
do animations with it.

But this simplicity didn't reflect enough my capabilities IMO so you know what
it means...

### Nuxt 3 and Tailwind CSS 3.0

![Screenshot of the portfolio v4](/images/content/en/projects/portfolio-5.png)

I upgraded Nuxt to its 3rd version (in beta) as well as Tailwind CSS (no major
changes). And I've got to say that Nuxt 3 and Vue 3 are absolutely amazing
compared to their previous major versions. Typescript is _the_ best. But using
Nuxt 3 in beta has downsides, for stability (laggy HMR), weird broken imports or
missing features. I'm mostly enjoying using it.

Concerning animations, I switched to
[`@vueuse/motion`](https://motion.vueuse.org/) and it's really better.

In fact, because nuxt's ecosystem isn't compatible yet, I had to dive a bit
deeper in Nuxt and learned how to build modules (for generating a sitemap for
instance) and that was really enriching.

If you're curious about it, I created a custom sitemap module,
[check it out](https://github.com/florian-lefebvre/portfolio/blob/c513428dea912a19ffb684b8b571b08b8882158c/modules/sitemap.ts).

I deploy my portfolio on Vercel, the process is way simpler than on GitHub
Actions or any other CI since Nuxt has first class integrations for deployments.

<Alert>

Do you miss this version? It's still available at
[v4.florian-lefebvre.dev](https://v4.florian-lefebvre.dev)!

</Alert>

But then I found out [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)'s
[e-book](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/effective-portfolio/): _"Building an
Effective Dev Portfolio"_. So I decided to rebuild my portfolio, but with more
thinking involved so that it can't stay great for a long time.

## Current status

I consider this website done and from now on, I'll refrain from reworking it. I
might do minor tweaks (color change) and updates (Astro 2.0) but that's all.

I'll keep it updated and I'll try to post articles here and there.

## Lessons Learned

Here are my key learnings:

-   Do at least a wireframe, it allows to gain a lot of time
-   Astro!
-   Radix UI Colors
-   Better accessibility

It was really useful, I used those learnings for
[RÃ©gioLangues](/projects/regiolangues).
