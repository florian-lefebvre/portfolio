## Introduction

Régiolangues is a centralized portal for French regional languages related
resources.

We decided to go with a recursive approach. Indeed we needed some kind of file
explorer logic with folders and files (here categories and resources).

For this project, I was in charge of designing the interface, its database and
coding the website. My brother was in charge of the content.

Here are the techs I used:

-   [Nuxt 2](https://nuxtjs.org)
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
-   [Supabase](https://supabase.com)

[Check out](https://regiolangues.fr) the website!

## Purpose and Goal

My brother enjoys Provençal (a French regional language) but felt that it was
difficult to learn it online, that there were not really websites concentrating
learning content and resources. So he asked me to build a website for this. The
goal was to be able to have many languages so that people can contribute.

## Spotlight: recursive architecture

I needed to build a breadcrumb navigation. But since the categories are
structured as `categories/${id}-${slugified-title}` on the website, i couldn't
use the url to build the breadcrumb. Instead, I wrote an rpc to get the
hierarchy of categories given a category id. Here is the code:

```sql
create or replace function public.category_hierarchy(id_param bigint)
returns categories[]
as $$
  declare arr categories[];
  declare x categories%rowtype;
begin
  select * into x from categories where id = id_param;
  arr = array_append(arr, x);
  while x.parent_id is not null loop
    select * into x from categories where id = x.parent_id;
    arr = array_append(arr, x);
  end loop;

  return arr;
end;
$$ language plpgsql security definer;
```

## Current status

Régiolangues is kind of abandoned right now, mainly because of a lack of content
and audience. It doesn't mean the project is dead yet but it requires more
attention on non-dev aspects.

## Lessons Learned

I learned:

-   To work with recursive data structures in SQL and recursive views
-   To use Supabase

Looking back at the choice of technologies:

-   I wish I could use Nuxt 3 but it was not mature enough (beta was released a
    few weeks after) so I had to work with Nuxt 2
-   Supabase was great because it's so easy to work with but it may be a bit
    overkill
