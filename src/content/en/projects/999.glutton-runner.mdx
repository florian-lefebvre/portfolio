## Introduction

Glutton Runner is an
[endless runner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endless_runner) game based on the
famous mobile game
[Subway Surfers](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiloo.subwaysurf&hl=fr&gl=US&pli=1).

In 2018, I discovered programming with the
[Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/). I wasn't not writing C++ but
blueprints instead, a visual scripting system that allowed me the same than
writing code.

At the time, I didn't understand the principle of functions so there was
duplicated code everywhere, it wasn't great. But still, I was able to write
games.

I don't remember a lot of things about developing Glutton Runner years ago, so
I'll make my best to find interesting things to talk about.

Play Store page is not accessible anymore, so nothing to show but screenshots!

## Challenges

I has literally no experience so the project was really challenging. Here are a
few challenges I faced:

### Target

First of all, I wanted to make a mobile game using Unreal Engine 4. It's pretty
heavy and I think it wasn't quite ready for such a small game at the time. Unity
would have been a much better choice.

Moreover, I developed the game on desktop so it was definitely not mobile
friendly nor optimized for mobile. I had to rework a lot of stuff.

### Performances

I wasn't a 3D modeler so I used a free pack on the Unreal Engine marketplace
which was [POLYGON - City](https://syntystore.com/products/polygon-city-pack)
pack from Synty Studios. It's a low poly city with a lot of assets but I wonder
if it was optimized enough for mobile.

In order to fix the performance issues, I unloaded any tiles (basically, the
game is about going through modules of assets like a bridge, a town etc) too far
from the player. I also added a fog (a sphere around the player with a grey
texture) to load the tiles as late as possible. I also added a shader to make
the view rounded and hide upcoming fog as much as possible.

I also manually worked on LODs (Level Of Detail) in order not to show too many
polygons if not needed.

## Current status

This game is unpublished from the Play Store, and has never been actually
playable on mobile devices. I don't plan on going back to it.

## Lessons Learned

So many lessons learned with this project!

-   First real introduction to programming
-   Project management and versionning with Trello
-   Deployment with the
    [Play Store Console](https://play.google.com/console/about/)
-   Taking care of performance
-   Basic material work
-   And so much more I forgot!
