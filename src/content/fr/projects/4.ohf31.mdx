## Introduction

-   High-level summary of what the project is
-   List of core functionalities / interesting features
-   Your role in the project. were you exclusively doing development, or did you
    do design? If you worked in groups, what parts did you tackle?
-   Technologies used
-   Links to live demo + source code (if applicable)

## Purpose and Goal

-   Why did you build this project? Why is it important to you?
-   What was the expected outcome of the project?
-   What were the initial designs?
-   Any other preliminary planning that you did which helps build a narrative

## Spotlight

-   What is the “killer feature” of your project? What feature does it have that
    took the most work, or was the most technically impressive? Some possible
    examples: - User authentication - A feed of items fetched from a database -
    A particularly tricky UI element (eg. autocomplete, calendar,
    drag-and-drop) - Anything you're proud of!
-   What were the technical hurdles that got in your way? Any major problems you
    hit during development?
-   How did you solve those problems? What was the solution? Go deep here, and
    write with a developer in mind.

## Current status

-   This section is optional. If the project is actively being used by real
    people, talk a little bit about the current status, who uses it, why they
    use it, what they say to you about it, stuff like that.
-   If the project was contrived specifically for the portfolio, omit this
    section.

## Lessons Learned

-   What did you learn doing this project? Feel free to list multiple things.
    Also feel free to cover non-technical lessons. It's great to talk about how
    you learned to use an advanced feature of a framework or library, but it's
    just as valuable to talk about project-management experience, or things you
    learned about shipping projects.
-   If you used a framework or other libraries/tools, was it a good choice? How
    did it help? In which ways was it insufficient?
-   Is your project accessible? What did you learn about accessibility, while
    building this project? Describing how you tested your project using keyboard
    navigation or a screenreader can make for a really compelling story!
-   How has this affected the work you've done since then? Real examples of how
    this project built your knowledge for future projects is fantastic.
