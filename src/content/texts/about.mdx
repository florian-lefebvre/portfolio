Younger, I managed a computer fleet before giving game development a try
with Unreal Engine 4. In late 2019, my curiosity led me to self-taught
exploration in web development. Despite my independent learning, I enrolled
early 2023 in a [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course)
bootcamp, where I obtained certification as a web designer and developer.

I learned a lot of things along the way: web development, UI/UX design
(mobile apps, design systems), project management, devops and more! I'm
curious and eager to learn new things.

Web development isn't my sole passion; I also have a deep love for playing
music! I've been honing my skills with various instruments for over a
decade, including drums, percussion, bass guitar, and even a bit of piano.
