<p>
    I've been wanting to make a portfolio for a while. I had tried to start one in php but I had given up because of
    more urgent projects. A few months later, I got serious about this project and I said to myself: "If I'm going to
    make my portfolio, I might as well do it while learning! Â»
</p>
<p>
    And I chose Jekyll, a static site generator running on Ruby.

<p>
    I followed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">series of tutorials on Youtube</a>, then I
    took a template on github that I customized. And that's it! (Don't worry, the next projects will be more detailed)
