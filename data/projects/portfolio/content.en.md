## Motivation

As a developer, having a portfolio online is a great to way to showcase my skills and experience, as well as learning new things along the way. 9 months after starting to learn web development, I wanted to build mine. I had done quite a lot of experiments but lacked real projects so it was a good exercise too. In the following, I'll go through the iterations of my website, explain choices I made and issues I faced. Enjoy reading!

## v1: Jekyll and Bootstrap

![v1](/images/projects/portfolio/portfolio-v1.png)

Back in August 2020, I had to choose technologies to build my portfolio. At the time, I knew HTML5, CSS & SCSS, PHP and Bootstrap.

Because I spent a lot of time on [Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs) in the previous months, I knew that static site generators existed (since Bootstrap docs use Hugo). So I searched for the best fit for me and eventually found [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

It uses the [Liquid syntax](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) and relies on [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/). I knew nothing about both of them so and it made it harder to build my portfolio.

Well, I think no screenshot is required...
