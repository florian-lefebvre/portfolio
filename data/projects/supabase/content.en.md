## What is Supabase

Supabase is the Open Source Firebase Alternative.

> Create a backend in less than 2 minutes. Start your project with a Postgres Database, Authentication, instant APIs, Realtime subscriptions and Storage.

Its goal is to offer an alternative to the Firebase platform, a vendor locked-in platform offering many features and used worldwide.

Its goal is not to have a 1 to 1 alternative for each feature of Firebase, but to offer similar services based on Open Source technologies. If it alredy exists, the Supabase team supports it (such as [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/)). If not, they build it.

For instance, unlike Firebase, Supabase uses Postgres as its database, instead of a NoSQL engine.

## My contributions

So far, I've only contributed by translating the README into French and making several frontend improvements.

For example, I added the annoucement nav bar you can see above the header.

## Wrapping up

I look forward to contributing more when I have time, especially to the studio now that it is open source.
