## Motivation

In high school, we had lunch cards that had a barcode on them. They were required to eat at the cafeteria but if it was lost, the school made them repay for around $7 or $8, which is pretty expensive for a stupid card.

During my first year of high school, a friend of mine was loosing her lunch card frequently so I thought I could do a tool to help her avoid repaying each time (this friend never used my website but never mind). Indeed, below the barcode was written the corresponding number, which can be used to generate it.

## Tech stack

It only took me 2 hours to get it working. For styling, I went with Bootstrap. For generating the barcode, I just used [JsBarcode](https://github.com/lindell/JsBarcode) and that was it, nice and simple.

## Wrapping up

A quick project that I did for fun but nothing amazing really.
