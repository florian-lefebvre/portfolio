**This article actually concerns the archived version of the website.**

## Motivation

Back in October 2020 when I discovered yNotes by chance on GitHub, I started to contribute to the project by reworking the website. I decided to go with HTML5, PostCSS and Tailwind CSS. It was fine but not that great so I decided to remake it once again. In between, I had learned Nuxt.js so that was a great exercice. The new website was released in January 2021.

## Tech stack

I used Nuxt.js 2 as the frontend framework (which is based on Vue 2), Tailwind CSS 2 for styling and AnimXYZ for animations (CSS based).

## Wrapping up

As of April 2022, yNotes is put on hold. As a consequence, I made a quick website explaining the reasons behind the decisions. I made it quickly using Vite, TypeScript, Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS.
