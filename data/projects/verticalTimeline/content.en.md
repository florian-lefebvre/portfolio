## Motivation

When I was making the 3rd version of my portfolio, I thought it would be cool to have a timeline of my learning journey. I first started to search on the Internet but I couldn't find anything great made in CSS only, most of them were some kind of jQuery plugins.

BTW, I reused this timeline for the [yNotes website](https://ynotes.fr).

## How it's done

At the time, I discovered CSS grid so I thought this was a great way to learn it. I used Tailwind CSS to make it quickly.

It uses flexbox for smaller screens and CSS grid for larger ones.

## Wrapping up

This little project was quite interesting to explore how CSS grid works.
